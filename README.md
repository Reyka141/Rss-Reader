# Rss Reader

## Description
Rss Reader is a service for aggregating RSS feeds, with the help of which it is convenient to read a variety of sources, such as blogs.
It allows you to add an unlimited number of RSS feeds, updates them itself and adds new entries to the common stream.
RSS is a specialized format designed to describe news feeds, article announcements and other content.
It is the easiest way for sites (usually blogs) to allow users to subscribe to changes.
For this purpose, special services called RSS-aggregators are used. 
These services are able to poll RSS-feeds of sites for the presence of new posts and show them in a convenient way, marking read and so on.
